The Drycc stack supports advanced use cases with custom Docker images. For most applications, we recommend using Drycc's default buildpack system, which provides automatic security updates, language-specific optimizations, and eliminates the need to maintain Dockerfiles.

## Drycc Config Path Overview

A Drycc repository supports two configurations:

* A `.drycc` directory at the root of the working tree
* A root directory as a 'bare' repository (without working tree), typically used for `drycc pull`

Repository contents include:

```
config/[a-z0-9]+(\.[a-z0-9]+)*::
        Configuration files named by group.
        Format follows environment variable syntax.

[a-z0-9]+(\-[a-z0-9]+)*.(yaml|yml)::
        Pipeline configuration files.
```

### Config Format

Environment variables use `<NAME>=<VALUE>` format. By convention, variable names are capitalized:

```
DEBUG=true
JVM_OPTIONS=-XX:+UseG1GC
```

### Pipeline Format

A manifest contains these top-level sections:

- `build` – Specifies Dockerfile for building
- `env` – Defines container environment variables
- `run` – Specifies release phase tasks
- `config` – References config groups (global groups referenced automatically)
- `deploy` – Defines deployment commands and arguments

Example manifest for building Docker images:

```
kind: pipeline
ptype: web
build:
  docker: Dockerfile
  arg:
    CODENAME: bookworm
env:
  VERSION: 1.2.1
run:
  command:
  - ./deployment-tasks.sh
  image: task
  timeout: 100
config:
- jvm-config
deploy:
  command:
  - bash
  - -ec
  args:
  - bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
```
