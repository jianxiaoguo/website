If you have a bare metal host, which can be a cloud server, bare metal server, virtual machine, or even your laptop, then this chapter is very suitable for you.

## Operating Systems

Drycc is expected to work on most modern Linux systems. Some operating systems have specific requirements:

* (Red Hat/CentOS) Enterprise Linux, which usually use RPM package management
* Ubuntu (Desktop/Server/Cloud) Linux, a very popular distribution
* Debian GNU Linux, a very pure distribution of open source software

If you want to add support for more Linux distributions, please submit an issue on GitHub or submit a PR directly.

## System Software

Some basic software needs to be installed before installing Drycc Workflow.

### OS Configuration

Kubernetes requires a large number of ports. If you are not sure what they are, please disable the local firewall or open these ports. At the same time, because Kubernetes needs system time synchronization, you need to ensure that the system time is correct.

### Installing NFSv4 Client

The command used to install an NFSv4 client differs depending on the Linux distribution.

For Debian and Ubuntu, use this command:

```
$ apt-get install nfs-common
```

For RHEL, CentOS, and EKS with EKS Kubernetes Worker AMI with AmazonLinux2 image, use this command:

```
$ yum install nfs-utils
```

### Installing curl

For Debian and Ubuntu, use this command:

```
$ apt-get install curl
```

For RHEL, CentOS, and EKS with EKS Kubernetes Worker AMI with AmazonLinux2 image, use this command:

```
$ yum install curl
```

## Hardware

Hardware requirements scale based on the size of your deployments. Minimum recommendations are outlined here.

* RAM: 1GB Minimum (we recommend at least 2GB)
* CPU: 1 Minimum

This configuration only contains the minimum requirements that can meet the operation.

## Disk

Drycc performance depends on the performance of the database. To ensure optimal speed, we recommend using an SSD when possible. Disk performance will vary on ARM devices utilizing an SD card or eMMC.

## Domain Name

Drycc needs a root domain name under your full control and points this domain name to the server to be installed. Suppose there is a wildcard domain pointing to the current server to install Drycc, which is the name `*.dryccdoman.com`. We need to set the `PLATFORM_DOMAIN` environment variables before installation.

```
$ export PLATFORM_DOMAIN=dryccdoman.com
```

Of course, if it is a test environment, we can also use `nip.io`, an IP to domain name service. For example, your host IP is `59.46.3.190`, we will get the following domain name `59.46.3.190.nip.io`:

```
$ export PLATFORM_DOMAIN=59.46.3.190.nip.io
```

## Install

Before installation, please make sure whether your installation environment is on the public network. If it is an intranet environment and there is no public IP, you need to disable the automatic certificate.

```
$ export CERT_MANAGER_ENABLED=false
```

Then you can use the installation script available at https://www.drycc.cc/install.sh to install Drycc as a service on systemd and openrc based systems.

```
$ curl -sfL https://www.drycc.cc/install.sh | bash -
```

To install the beta version, please use the following script for installation.

```
$ export CHANNEL=testing
$ curl -sfL https://drycc-mirrors.drycc.cc/drycc/workflow/raw/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash -
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="danger" %}}
If you are in China, you need to use mirror acceleration:

```
$ curl -sfL https://www.drycc.cc/install.sh | INSTALL_DRYCC_MIRROR=cn bash -
```
{{% /alert %}}

### Install Node

A node can be a simple agent or a server; a server has the function of an agent. Multiple servers provide high availability, but the number of servers should not exceed 7 at most. There is no limit to the number of agents.

* First, check the cluster token of the master:

```
$ cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
K1078e7213ca32bdaabb44536f14b9ce7926bb201f41c3f3edd39975c16ff4901ea::server:33bde27f-ac49-4483-b6ac-f4eec2c6dbfa
```

We assume that the IP address of the cluster master is `192.168.6.240`.

* Then, set the environment variables:

```
$ export K3S_URL=https://192.168.6.240:6443
$ export K3S_TOKEN="K1078e7213ca32bdaabb44536f14b9ce7926bb201f41c3f3edd39975c16ff4901ea::server:33bde27f-ac49-4483-b6ac-f4eec2c6dbfa"
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="danger" %}}
If you are in China, you need to use mirror acceleration:

```
$ export INSTALL_DRYCC_MIRROR=cn
```
{{% /alert %}}

* Join the cluster as server:

```
$ curl -sfL https://www.drycc.cc/install.sh | bash -s - install_k3s_server
```

* Join the cluster as agent:

```
$ curl -sfL https://www.drycc.cc/install.sh | bash -s - install_k3s_agent
```
